## Phishing Email Alert: How to Spot a Scam Fast    

Wondering if that email in your inbox is trying to trick you? If you answer "yes" to any of these signs, be cautious—it could be a scam.    
Check Who Sent It

    Is the sender’s address from a generic provider like Gmail but claiming to be a company?
    Is the website domain just a little off or misspelled (like amaz0n instead of amazon)?
    Does the sender’s email look different from what you usually get from that company?    

Read the Message Carefully

    Are there typos or awkward grammar mistakes?
    Does it pressure you to act immediately, with phrases like “Urgent” or “Your account will be suspended”?
    Does the tone feel unusual or not like the normal communication style you’re familiar with?    

Inspect Links and Attachments

    Does the link’s URL not match the clickable text?
    Did they include attachments you weren’t expecting?
    Are the buttons or links vague, saying things like “Click here” or “Verify now”?    

Watch Out for Pressure Tactics

    Are they asking for sensitive details like passwords or personal info?
    Do they urge you to ignore normal company procedures?
    Do they threaten consequences if you don’t respond quickly?    

If any of this rings true, don’t click or download anything. Instead, get in touch with the company directly using a verified contact source before taking any action.    
Stay safe and always double-check suspicious emails!    

## Outcome  
Enhancing awareness of phishing tactics and improving email threat analysis skills to stay protected against cyber threats.
